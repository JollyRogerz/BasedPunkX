/**
 * @title LSP16 Universal Factory
 * @dev Factory contract to deploy different types of contracts using the CREATE2 opcode
 * standardized as LSP16 - UniversalFactory:
 * https://github.com/lukso-network/LIPs/blob/main/LSPs/LSP-16-UniversalFactory.md
 *
 * The UniversalFactory will be deployed using Nick's Factory (0x4e59b44847b379578588920ca78fbf26c0b4956c)
 *
 * The deployed address can be found in the LSP16 specification.
 * Please refer to the LSP16 Specification to obtain the exact bytecode and salt that
 * should be used to produce the address of the UniversalFactory on different chains.
 *
 * This factory contract is designed to deploy contracts at the same address on multiple chains.
 *
 * The UniversalFactory can deploy 2 types of contracts:
 * - non-initializable (normal deployment)
 * - initializable (external call after deployment, e.g: proxy contracts)
 *
 * The `providedSalt` parameter given by the deployer is not used directly as the salt by the CREATE2 opcode.
 * Instead, it is used along with these parameters:
 *  - `initializable` boolean
 *  - `initializeCalldata` (when the contract is initializable and `initializable` is set to `true`).
 * These three parameters are concatenated together and hashed to generate the final salt for CREATE2.
 *
 * See {generateSalt} function for more details.
 *
 * The constructor and `initializeCalldata` SHOULD NOT include any network-specific parameters (e.g: chain-id,
 * a local token contract address), otherwise the deployed contract will not be recreated at the same address
 * across different networks, thus defeating the purpose of the UniversalFactory.
 *
 * One way to solve this problem is to set an EOA owner in the `initializeCalldata`/constructor
 * that can later call functions that set these parameters as variables in the contract.
 *
 * The UniversalFactory must be deployed at the same address on different chains to successfully deploy
 * contracts at the same address across different chains.

     * @dev Generates the salt used to deploy the contract by hashing the following parameters (concatenated together) with keccak256:
     * 1. the `providedSalt`
     * 2. the `initializable` boolean
     * 3. the `initializeCalldata`, only if the contract is initializable (the `initializable` boolean is set to `true`)
     *
     * - The `providedSalt` parameter is not used directly as the salt by the CREATE2 opcode. Instead, it is used along with these parameters:
     *  1. `initializable` boolean
     *  2. `initializeCalldata` (when the contract is initializable and `initializable` is set to `true`).
     *
     * - This approach ensures that in order to reproduce an initializable contract at the same address on another chain, not only the `providedSalt` is required to be the same, but also the initialize parameters within the `initializeCalldata` must also be the same. This maintains consistent deployment behaviour. Users are required to initialize contracts with the same parameters across different chains to ensure contracts are deployed at the same address across different chains.
     *
     * 1. Example (for initializable contracts)
     *
     * -  For an existing contract A on chain 1 owned by X, to replicate the same contract at the same address with
     * the same owner X on chain 2, the salt used to generate the address should include the initializeCalldata
     * that assigns X as the owner of contract A.
     *
     * - For instance, if another user, Y, tries to deploy the contract at the same address
     * on chain 2 using the same providedSalt, but with a different initializeCalldata to make Y the owner instead of X,
     * the generated address would be different, preventing Y from deploying the contract with different ownership
     * at the same address.
     *
     * - However, for non-initializable contracts, if the constructor has arguments that specify the deployment behavior, they
     * will be included in the bytecode. Any change in the constructor arguments will lead to a different contract's bytecode
     * which will result in a different address on other chains.
     *
     * 2. Example (for non-initializable contracts)
     *
     * - If a contract is deployed with specific constructor arguments on chain 1, these arguments are embedded within the bytecode.
     * For instance, if contract B is deployed with a specific `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol` on chain 1, and a user wants to deploy
     * the same contract with the same `tokenName` and `tokenSymbol` on chain 2, they must use the same constructor arguments to
     * produce the same bytecode. This ensures that the same deployment behaviour is maintained across different chains,
     * as long as the same bytecode is used.
     *
     * - If another user Z, tries to deploy the same contract B at the same address on chain 2 using the same `providedSalt`
     * but different constructor arguments (a different `tokenName` and/or `tokenSymbol`), the generated address will be different.
     * This prevents user Z from deploying the contract with different constructor arguments at the same address on chain 2.
     *
     * - The providedSalt was hashed to produce the salt used by CREATE2 opcode to prevent users from deploying initializable contracts
     * using non-initializable functions such as {deployCreate2} without having the initialization call.
     *
     * - In other words, if the providedSalt was not hashed and was used as it is as the salt by the CREATE2 opcode, malicious users
     * can check the generated salt used for the already deployed initializable contract on chain 1, and deploy the contract
     * from {deployCreate2} function on chain 2, with passing the generated salt of the deployed contract as providedSalt
     * that will produce the same address but without the initialization, where the malicious user can initialize after.
     *
     * @param initializable The Boolean that specifies if the contract must be initialized or not
