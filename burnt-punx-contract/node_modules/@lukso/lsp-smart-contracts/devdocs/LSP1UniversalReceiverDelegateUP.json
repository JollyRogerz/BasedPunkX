The {LSP1UniversalReceiverDelegateUP} is a contract called by the {universalReceiver(...)} function of the [LSP-0-ERC725Account] contract that: - Writes the data keys representing assets received from type [LSP-7-DigitalAsset] and [LSP-8-IdentifiableDigitalAsset] into the account storage, and removes them when the balance is zero according to the [LSP-5-ReceivedAssets] Standard. - Writes the data keys representing the owned vaults from type [LSP-9-Vault] into your account storage, and removes them when transferring ownership to other accounts according to the [LSP-10-ReceivedVaults] Standard.",
